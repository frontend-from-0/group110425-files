### 🧱 **1. String (metin)**
Used for **text**.

```js

📦 It’s stored with `" "` or `' '`.

Used for any number: **whole or decimal**.

```js
let age = 33;
let price = 9.99;
```

### ❓ **3. Boolean (mantıksal)**
Used for **true or false** values.

let isStudent = true;
let isAdmin = false;
```
💡 Great for yes/no, on/off type logic.

### 🚫 **4. Undefined**
A variable that has been **declared** but has **no value yet**.

Now `email` is `undefined`.

let car = null;
```

### 📦 **6. Object**

  age: 30,
  isMarried: true
